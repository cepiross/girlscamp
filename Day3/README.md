Day 3 - Training computers to recognize objects (July 19, 2017 Wed)
------------
This lecture introduced object recognition based on [Speeded Up Robust Features (SURF)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speeded_up_robust_features) and [Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) To be specific, the following items are dealt with:

1. SURF training on the fly
   * [JeVois](https://jevois.org/doc) Smart Machine Vision Camera 
1. CNN Inference on NVIDIA [DIGITS 5](https://developer.nvidia.com/digits)
   * Object detection: [DetectNet](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/detectnet-deep-neural-network-object-detection-digits/)
   * Object classification: [GoogLeNet](https://research.google.com/pubs/pub43022.html)
